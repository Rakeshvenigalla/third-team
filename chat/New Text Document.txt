The collection contains detailed transactional records from numerous Istanbul shopping centers. It contains a variety of information about customer purchases, such as demographic information, product categories, quantities, prices, payment methods, invoice dates, and the shopping mall where the transactionÂ occurred.





i think this are   good question 

	Do younger customers spend more on certain product categories than older customers, Is there a link between a customer's age and their chosen shopping mall?


Can we find any meaningful correlations between various factors?
