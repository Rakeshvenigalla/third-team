i think this are   good question 

	Do younger customers spend more on certain product categories than older customers, Is there a link between a customer's age and their chosen shopping mall?


Can we find any meaningful correlations between various factors?
=======
I am Writing the smart questions can confirm this on the choosen dataset?

What is the gender and age distribution of your customers, Is it possible to discern trends or patterns in shopping behavior based on gender and age?


Is there a link between characteristics such as age and spending?

i agree with this question

yeah i agree with these questions and here are my questions for dataset:

What is the most popular payment method among customers, Is there a link between the payment method and the location of the shopping mall?

Is there a repeat client base, and if yes, how has their spending changed over time?
