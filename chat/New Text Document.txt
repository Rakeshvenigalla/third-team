i think this are   good question 

	Do younger customers spend more on certain product categories than older customers, Is there a link between a customer's age and their chosen shopping mall?


Can we find any meaningful correlations between various factors?

I'm proposing a SMART question can you check it out?

"Is there a link between the number of products purchased and the total cost, Do specific product categories have greater purchase rates?"
++++++++++++


do you want to make any other change in questions

===============================================================================


guys i have some suggestions, how about choosing the one standard target variable instead of many,. so that this can give the multiple attribute impact on target variable.
 
the question may be:
total purchase amount significantly differ between male and female customers this can give any gender insights and how about the age?
======================


Hello, this is my suggestion:

Are certain product categories associated with higher total purchase amounts than others?
===================================
we can try by changing names
i to got the same error
i will update code as soom as possible and let u know adout it
