i want to make this updates in our project
+++++++++++++++
Introduction:
In the modeling phase, we leverage our comprehensive EDA of the Istanbul customer dataset to analyze the total purchase values from 2021 to present. Statistical models will help uncover patterns, draw conclusions, and forecast future trends in the retail dataset.
  and want to add a smart question
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Is there a correlation between a customer's age and gender effect on shopping behavior?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


yes rakesh i am agreeing totally with you i will suggest some models
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Goalof the model:
The project aims to build robust Regression models for SMART questions based on exploratory data analysis. These models will explain historical economic behaviors and predict future trends in retail payments, providing actionable insights for economic strategists in shopping malls.
