i want to make this updates in our project
+++++++++++++++
Introduction:
In the modeling phase, we leverage our comprehensive EDA of the Istanbul customer dataset to analyze the total purchase values from 2021 to present. Statistical models will help uncover patterns, draw conclusions, and forecast future trends in the retail dataset.
  and want to add a smart question
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Is there a correlation between a customer's age and gender effect on shopping behavior?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


yes rakesh i am agreeing totally with you i will suggest some models
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Goalof the model:
The project aims to build robust Regression models for SMART questions based on exploratory data analysis. These models will explain historical economic behaviors and predict future trends in retail payments, providing actionable insights for economic strategists in shopping malls.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

but i am currently thinking of the random forest and desicion analysis 
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

how about your suggestions guys:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

we can do the regression for all the models it would be nice and also we can draw some of the conclusions tooo
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

3.	Does the shopping mall location affect the purchaseÂ frequency?

Description:
The Istanbul Shopping Dataset comprises 99458 records from ten malls in Istanbul (2021-2023), featuring invoice numbers, client IDs, demographics, payment methods, and product details. It is a valuable resource for understanding consumer behaviour and decision-making in Istanbul's retail scene.
