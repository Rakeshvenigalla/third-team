```{r}
customer_data=read.csv((file.choose()))
# Convert date to a proper date format
customer_data$invoice_date = as.Date(customer_data$invoice_date, format = "%d/%m/%Y")
```

##Defining the Target Variable

```{r}

customer_data$total_cost <- customer_data$quantity * customer_data$price

head(customer_data)
```

## Verifying the Null Values and Data Claeaning

```{r}
# Check for missing values
sum(is.na(customer_data))
```

```{r, results='markup'}
# Check data types
str(customer_data)
```

## Ensure proper factors

```{r, results='markup'}

customer_data$gender = factor(customer_data$gender)
customer_data$category = factor(customer_data$category)
customer_data$payment_method = factor(customer_data$payment_method)
customer_data$shopping_mall = factor(customer_data$shopping_mall)


```

## Check the dataset For Analysis

```{r, results='markup'}

head(customer_data)
#summary(customer_data)
```

## Subsetting the dataset based on different conditions

```{r, results='markup'}


# Subsetting the dataset for female customers
female_customers = subset(customer_data, gender == "Female")
head(female_customers)
# Subsetting the dataset for customers older than 30
older_customers = subset(customer_data, age > 30)
head(older_customers)
# Subsetting the dataset for Clothing category
clothing_data = subset(customer_data, category == "Clothing")
head(clothing_data)
# Subsetting the dataset for customers who shopped at Kanyon mall
kanyon_shoppers = subset(customer_data, shopping_mall == "Kanyon")
head(kanyon_shoppers)
# Subsetting the dataset for customers who used Credit Card as the payment method
credit_card_customers = subset(customer_data, payment_method == "Credit Card")
head(credit_card_customers)
