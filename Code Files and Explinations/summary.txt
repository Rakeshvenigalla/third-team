# Introduction

This project is based on the Customer Shopping Dataset - Retail Sales Data provided by Kaggle. We will do data visualization studies with Rstudio using this data set.

## Topic Choice

We selected this dataset because to our strong interest in retail client sales in the shopping sector. Istanbul was our choice since the Kaggle dataset includes exact content without any null values and very few insights when compared to other locations.

## Prior Research

While there have been other analyses of this dataset conducted online, one in particular appears to be rather impressive. It was conducted with PowerBI, and the author established a connection between several variables and parameters, including age, gender, invoice date, and mode of payment.  


# Dataset Information

## Description

The Istanbul Shopping Dataset is a comprehensive collection of shopping data obtained from ten different malls in Istanbul between 2021 and 2023. Invoice numbers, client IDs, age, gender, payment methods, product categories, quantity, price, order dates, and shopping mall locations are all included. This dataset is a fantastic resource for researchers, data analysts, and machine learning enthusiasts interested in uncovering trends and patterns in Istanbul’s buying behavior. This dataset, which includes 99458 records, and 10 fields provides a base for companies wishing to use data-driven insights for better decision-making and customer-centric initiatives.

The dataset contains 10 columns:

customer_id: The client's ID. Quantal. 'C' combined with a six-digit number that is specifically allocated to every operation.
gender: The customer's gender as a string variable.
age: Aggressive The age of the consumer is an integer variable.
category: The purchased product's category as represented by a string variable.
quantity: The number of units of every item (product) sold in a transaction. Price in numbers: Cost per unit. Counting. The unit price of the product in Turkish Liras (TL).
payment_method: String variable indicating the mode of payment (debit, credit, or cash) applied to the transaction.
invoice_date: Date of invoice. the day a transaction came into being.
Shopping_mall: A string variable containing the name of the mall where the purchase was completed.

## Limitations

Since most correlations are conducted online, we have created a new variable called "totalcost," which is the result of multiplying quantity by price and is useful in many correlations. The dataset does not contain any null values, but it does contain string values related to gender, payment methods, and categories, which we have assigned numeric values.


# SMART Questions

## Question 1: Does the total purchase amount significantly differ between male and female customers?

We asked ourselves this question as we were considering how different women were from men with respective to purchases.
With regard to our goal variable, total price against gender, we have conducted the hypothesis testing.
Null Hypothesis (H0): The total purchase amount does not significantly differ between 
male and female customers.
Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The total purchase amount significantly differs between male and female customers
since we got pvalue of 0.7472 which was greater than the ordinal pvalue of 0.05 so we have rejected the alternate hypothesis and for this We used “ggplot” to compare the relation between Males and Total cost spend on shopping.
On x-axis we have Gender as Male and on y-axis we have Total cost where 1unit is 10000$.


## Question 2: Is there a correlation between a customer's age and the total amount spent? Do younger or older customers spend more?

We wondered if there was a relationship between age and purchasing behavior—that is, if older or younger persons made more purchases.
We have carried out the hypothesis testing with respect to our target variable, total price against age.
Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no correlation between a customer's age and the total amount spent.
Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a correlation between a customer's age and the total amount spent.

## Question 3: Is there a positive correlation between the quantity of products purchased and the total cost of the shopping? Does the choice of payment method affect the total purchase amount? Are credit card users more likely to spend more?

We were thinking about how age related to the price of the things we bought when we came up with this question.
We have tested our hypothesis concerning our goal variable, total price compared to products.
Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference in total purchase amounts 
across different product categories.
Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a significant difference in total purchase 
amounts across different product categories.
We have rejected the alternative hypothesis since our pvalue of 0.9 was higher than the ordinal pvalue of 0.05.
We have a Histogram that shows the relationship between the categories and the overall cost of the things purchased.
We have categories on the x-axis and Mean Total Cost on the y-axis, with 1 unit equaling 3000$.

Customers spent more money on technology than on any other item, with roughly $12,000 spent on it alone.
The next step in technology is footwear and apparel, which cost roughly $6500 and $3200, respectively.
Food and beverages, as well as souvenirs, are among the least expensive goods. 

========================================================
## Question 4: Are certain product categories associated with higher total purchase amounts than others?

We believed that this question would be useful to compare which product category generates the most money.
With regard to our objective variable, total price relative to items, we have tested our hypothesis.
Null Hypothesis (H0): The choice of payment method does not affect the total purchase amount.
Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The choice of payment method affects the total purchase amount.
Since our pvalue of 0.6548 was more than the ordinal pvalue of 0.05, we have accepted the null hypothesis. and we made multiple-box graphic that depicts the relationship between Payment methods and Total cost.
On the x-axis are three payment methods (credit, debit, and cash), and on the y-axis is the total amount spent by these means, where one unit represents $10,000. 
We might claim that there is almost no distinction between them since they are all the same. 
Because the total amount spent is split equally across these three payment options.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Before the Exploratory Data Analysis we used to have smart questions of:
1.	What is the gender and age distribution of your customers, is it possible to discern trends or patterns in shopping behavior based on gender and age?
2.	Do younger customers spend more on certain product categories than older customers, Is there a link between a customer's age and their chosen shopping mall?
3.	What is the most popular payment method among customers, Is there a link between the payment method and the shopping location?
4.	Is there a link between the number of prorates? purchased and the total cost, do specific product categories have greater purchase rates?

We have chosen to take into consideration a target variable as total cost, which was association of total products purchased and cost of the product and made correlations and hypothesis testing towards this variable, since these questions are associated with different variables and as there would be similar conclusions as git.

# Statistical Tests

we have created distribution graphs for certain variables
2.1 Distribution Graphs 

2.1.1 Age Distribution: 

We have 'Age' on the x-axis with one unit equaling 20 years and 'Frequency' on the y-axis with one unit equaling 2500 occurrence frequency. 
We can easily observe that the participants are evenly spread throughout all ages, ranging from 20 to 65. There are around 9500 persons in each age group ranging from 20 to 65 years old. 
When it comes to age 70, there are only around 4000 of them, which is a significant decrease.  

2.1.2 Price Distribution:

We have 'Price' on the x-axis and 'Frequency' on the y-axis, with one unit equivalent to a price range of 2,000$ on the x-axis and 5000 customers on the y-axis.
If we examine attentively, we can see that the bulk of people's expenditure is less than $500.
Following that, a small number of clients prefer to purchase things worth $1,000 to $1,500 more frequently.
Once we approach the 2,000$ purchase line, there are no patterns or spending sprees since a given percentage of consumers tend to purchase a certain item, therefore the graph just displays a few frequencies on a specific price range. 
The most substantial number of clients are ready to spend roughly $5500.

2.1.3 Quantity Distribution:

In this graph, we have 'Quantity' on the x-axis, with 1 quantity equaling 1 unit, and 'Frequency' on the y-axis, with 1 unit equaling 5000 Frequency.
As can be seen, regardless of the quantity purchased, the total number of clients purchasing the specified number of things is about the same for each quantity. 

When compared to the rest of the population, consumers tend to buy 3 or 5 products while shopping, as seen by the small rise in the graph. 

2.2 Plotting the Feature vs Feature Graph Comparison:

2.2.1 Count Plot of Gender

This graph indicates which gender (Male, Female) purchases the most goods while shopping, i.e. the number of products purchased. Females are represented by the colour orange, whereas men are represented by the colour cyan. 
Gender (Male, Female) is on the x-axis, while the count is on the y-axis, with 1 unit equaling 20000 things purchased.
There is a clear portrayal that women tend to purchase more products than males. 
The ladies collectively purchased around 60000 goods, while the males collectively purchased 40000 items. 

2.2.2 Count Plot of Category

This graph displays the number of things purchased from each category.
We have numerous categories of data on the x-axis (Books, Clothing, Cosmetics, Food & Beverages, Shoes, Souvenir, Technology, Toys) and the count of these products bought on the y-axis (1 unit = 10000 items bought).
Customers are purchasing more apparel goods, as seen by the item count of roughly 34000, while books, souvenirs, and technology are purchased in the least number. Cosmetics, food, and beverages are purchased reasonably following apparel, which has a count of roughly 15000.
Toys and shoes are not as well-known among buyers as other categories, as they were only in the 10,000 range.

2.2.3 Count Plot of Payment Method

This graph depicts the total number of payments made via cash, credit card, and debit card.
The three payment methods, Cash, Credit Card, and Debit Card, are represented by three distinct colors on the x-axis, while the count of these payments is indicated on the y-axis. 
The payment types are clearly distinguished. The majority of clients paid in cash (about 45000 payments), followed by credit card (35000 payments), and debit card (almost 20000 payments). 


# Interpretation of Results

Initially, feature engineering was used to categorize the dataset's strings into numerical datatypes and do some variable correlation.

3 Feature Engineering

3.1 Age Distribution by Gender

The Box Plot depicts the gender vs. age distribution of the clients. 
Genders (Female, Male) are on the x-axis, while Age is on the y-axis, with 1 unit equaling 10 years.
We may conclude that the ages of both male and female customers are the same because there is no discernible difference.


4.1 Calculating the correlation matrix for numerical variables.

On both axes, we have a correlation matrix with all of the values (Age, Quantity, Price, Total Cost, Gender, Payment Method) depicted.
They create a matrix-like structure that represents the relationship between them and is represented by values ranging from -1 to 1 (Warmer to Colder).
If the number is near to 1, there is a positive relationship; if it is close to -1, there is little to no relationship.


# Conclusions

To sum up, we have produced an analysis for our smart questions and built a hypothesis test for variables like gender, age, payment methods, and product categories. We also developed a new variable called total cost, which was the product cost multiplied by the quantity. Additionally, we conducted a study on product trends that offers insightful information on how to maximize retail sales. By better understanding consumer behavior, spotting market trends, refining pricing strategies, enhancing customer satisfaction, and streamlining inventory control, retailers can boost sales, boost profitability, and outperform the competition.
