#The coefficients from a linear regression model predicting the quantity of a variable based on the existence of several shopping malls are represented in the result. The intercept is 2.995191, which is the baseline number when no specific retail center is taken into account. Positive coefficients for malls such as Emaar Square Mall, Forum Istanbul, Istinye Park, and Mall of Istanbul signify that clients affiliated with these malls have larger quantities. Negative coefficients for Metrocity and Viaport Outlet, on the other hand, indicate a probable decline in client number associated with these malls and These coefficients provide light on the differing degrees of effect that different shopping malls have on the quantity variable, providing useful information for understanding consumer behavior and developing company strategies based on shopping mall associations.

#The bar plot says that location has a considerable impact on the frequency of shopping. The Istanbul mall and Kanyon location have the most transactions. The linear regression analysis offers information about the relationship between the quantity variable and the different retail malls in the dataset. The intercept, which represents the baseline number when no specific shopping mall is taken into account, is assessed to be 2.995191 with a high level of statistical significance. However, when the coefficients for particular retail malls are examined, none of them have a statistically significant influence on the quantity variable. The p-values for each coefficient indicate that the existence of these retail malls has no significant effect on the quantity variable. The low R-squared values also imply that the model does not explain a large portion of the variation in the quantity variable, In summary, We may conclude from the regression results that there is no statistically significant association between the location of the shopping center and the quantity purchased. Based on the statistics in the dataset, a bar plot demonstrates that the Mall of Istanbul and Mall of Kanyon have the biggest purchase quantity. This implies that a bar plot just depicts the distribution of data and does not provide evidence for causation or correlations between variables.

The model comprises three coefficients that indicate the intercept and the influence of two payment methods on the pricing, namely Credit Card and Debit Card. The intercept, at 690.82, represents the baseline pricing when no specific approach is taken into account. However, the coefficients for Credit Card and Debit Card, -2.28 and -3.79, respectively, show that these payment methods may result in a price drop, while these effects are not statistically significant given their p-values of 0.73 and 0.64. The entire model's low Multiple R-squared (2.57e-06) and Adjusted R-squared (-1.75e-05) values show weak explanatory power, and the F-statistic (0.128) with a p-value of 0.88 suggests that the model is insignificant. In conclusion, the payment method does not appear to be a significant predictor of product prices in the present analysis, and the model does not provide useful insights into pricing dynamics based on payment methods in the supplied dataset.
